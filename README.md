**PLEASE NOTE THAT ZOOMSCHEDULES IS NOT FINISHED YET. VERSION 1.0 IS SCHEDULED FOR RELEASE IN JULY.**

# Zoom Schedules
ZoomSchedules is a chrome extension that will open up a new tab with a zoom link right when a meeting is scheduled to start! Timings and zoom links can be quickly adjusted under the "Schedules" page on the popup. It is highly recommended to keep the extension pinned, so that you can easily access it. See below for more information.

## How to use

## Latest release

There are no releases just yet as we're still working on the project. Version 1.0 should be available sometime in July 2021.

## Installation instructions

To install ZoomSchedules, head to the latest release in the "releases" section of the GitHub page. Download the folder. Once downloaded, right click on the .zip file and select "Extract all". Then, go to chrome://extensions, and hit "Load unpacked". Selected the extracted folder, and pin the extension. Now you can start scheduling!
