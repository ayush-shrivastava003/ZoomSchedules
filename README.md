**PLEASE NOTE THAT ZOOMSCHEDULES IS NOT FINISHED YET**

# Zoom Schedules
ZoomSchedules is a chrome extension that will open up a new tab with a zoom link right when a meeting is scheduled to start! Timings and zoom links can be quickly adjusted under the "Schedules" page on the popup. It is highly recommended to keep the extension pinned, so that you can easily access it. See below for more information.

## How to use

Since the chrome extension isn't finished, we recommend that you instead install the script application. This will still do the exact same thing but will require a *little* bit more of your computer's resources.

## FAQ
* Will the extension be available on other platforms?
  For now ZoomSchedules will only be available for chrome or as a script application, but we will aim to have support for other browsers soon!
* Which is better, the chrome extension or script application?
  It'll generally be a better idea to install the chrome extension, since the script application uses more of your computers resources. It's still a great alternative if the extension has a problem, though!
* There's a bug that's come up. How do I report it?
  This extension will probably be full of bugs, so it is recommended that you fill out our bug report [here](https://forms.gle/tYEQjidhk7eeDfRP7). 
  
## Latest release

There are no releases just yet as we're still working on the project. The extension should be finished by July, but changes will constantly be made after that.

## Installation instructions

To install ZoomSchedules, head to the latest release in the "releases" section of the GitHub page. Download the folder. Once downloaded, right click on the .zip file and select "Extract all". Then, go to chrome://extensions, and hit "Load unpacked". Selected the extracted folder, and pin the extension. Now you can start scheduling!
