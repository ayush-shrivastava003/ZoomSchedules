            Have you heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

        I thought not. It's not a story the jedi would tell you. It's a Sith Legend.
        Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise, he could influence the midichlorians to create.. life.
        Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, and he killed him in his sleep.
        Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
